=== List creation


[.fragment]
--
You can mix element of different types inside a list
[source.eval-clojure, clojure]
(list 1 2 "hello")
--

[.fragment]
--
You can nest lists inside lists inside lists inside lists...
[source.eval-clojure, clojure]
(list 1 2 (list "a" "b") (list 1.2 (list 3.43243 2.5)))
--

[.fragment]
--
There is a syntactic sugar for list creation: the single quote `'`
[source.eval-clojure, clojure]
'(1 2 3)
--

[.fragment]
--
And it works fine with nested lists
[source.eval-clojure, clojure]
'(1 2 ("a" "b" (1 2 4)))
--

=== Functions on lists

[.fragment]
--
The most natural manipulation on a list is to take the list without its first element
[source.eval-clojure, clojure]
(rest '(1 2 3 4 5))
--

[.fragment]
--
In order to get the first element of a list, use first
[source.eval-clojure, clojure]
(first '(1 2 3 4 5))
--

[.fragment]
--
Lists are linked lists, therefore elements are prepended *efficiently* to the head of the list
[source.eval-clojure, clojure]
(cons 1 '(2 3))
--

[.fragment]
--
You can count the elements of a list, but it's not efficient
[source.eval-clojure, clojure]
(count '(1 2 3 4 5))
--

=== Lists - Practice

> Write a function that receives a list and returns its fifth element.

[source.eval-clojure, clojure]
(defn fifth [lst]
;; Write your code here
)

{bl}
[source.eval-clojure, clojure]
(assert (= (fifth '(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8)) 5))

=== Lists - Practice (2)

> {challenge} Write a function that receives a number `n` and a list and returns its nth element. You'll need to use recursion.

[source.eval-clojure, clojure]
(defn nth-element [lst n])

{bl}

[source.eval-clojure, clojure]
(assert (= (nth-element '(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11) 10) 10))


=== Lists - Practice (3)

> {challenge} Write a function called `select-1-5-7` that receives a list and returns a list with the elements of the original list at positions 1, 5 and 7.

You might use either your `nth-element` function or clojure `nth`.

[source.eval-clojure, clojure]
(defn select-1-5-7 [lst])

{bl}

[source.eval-clojure, clojure]
(assert (= (select-1-5-7 (range 10)) '(0 4 6)))

== Vectors

*Vectors* are like *lists* but with *fast random access*.

=== Vector creation

[.fragment]
--
Vectors are created using `vector`
[source.eval-clojure, clojure]
(vector 1 2 3 4 5)
--

{bl}

[.fragment]
--
We can convert a list into a vector using `apply`
[source.eval-clojure, clojure]
(apply vector '(1 2 3 4 5))
--

{bl}

[.fragment]
--
Nested vectors can be created using the literal `[]`
[source.eval-clojure, clojure]
(def a [1 2 3 4 "aa" [1 2] [1 2 3]])
a
--

=== Vectors vs lists: performances

[cols="2*", frame=none, grid=none]
|===
a| [.fragment]
--
Let's create a very long list
[source.eval-clojure, clojure]
(def long-list (reverse
(reverse (range 1e6))))
--

a|[.fragment]
--
And a long vector
[source.eval-clojure, clojure]
(def long-vec (vec long-list))
--
|===


[.fragment]
--
Let's compare the perfs
[cols="2*", frame=none, grid=none]
|===
a|
[source.eval-clojure, clojure]
----
(time (nth long-list (dec 1e6)))
----

a|
[source.eval-clojure, clojure]
----
(time (nth long-vec (dec 1e6)))
----
|===
--

[.fragment]
--
{meditation} Why is `last` so slow on a vector?
[source.eval-clojure, clojure]
(time (last long-vec))
--
=== Vectors vs lists

[.fragment]
{meditation} Why do we need lists if vectors has better performances?

{bl}

[.fragment]
* Lists are more efficient in terms of memory
* For iterations, lists are more efficient in terms of CPU
* Deep argument: When a list is enough why would we use a vector?


=== The sequence abstraction

[.fragment]
--
The sequence functions work on any collection: like with lists, you can access the first element with `first`
[source.eval-clojure, clojure]
(first [1 2 3 4 5])
--

[.fragment]
--
Be careful: `rest` always returns a sequence!
[source.eval-clojure, clojure]
(rest [1 2 3 4 5])
--

[.fragment]
--
Notice that a sequence is not the same as a list
[source.eval-clojure, clojure]
(= (type (rest [1 2 3 4 5])) (type '(2 3 4 5)))
--

[.fragment]
--
Equality check the values not the concretes sequence type

[source.eval-clojure, clojure]
(= (rest [1 2 3 4 5]) '(2 3 4 5))
--

=== Vectors - Practice

> Write a function that receives a vector and converts it to a list

[source.eval-clojure, clojure]
(defn ->list [vec])

{bl}

[source.eval-clojure, clojure]
(assert (= (->list [1 2]) '(1 2)))

=== Vectors - Practice (2)

> Write a recursive function that receives a vector and a "thing" and returns `true` or `false` according to the presence of the "thing" in the vector

{meditation} Why such a function is not implemented in `clojure.core`?

[source.eval-clojure, clojure]
(defn present? [v thing])

{bl}

[source.eval-clojure, clojure]
(assert (= (present? [1 2 3] 1)
           true))

[source.eval-clojure, clojure]
(assert (= (present? [1 2 3] 18)
           false))
