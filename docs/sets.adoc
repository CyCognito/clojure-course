== Sets - creation

To create a set from a collection, you use set:

(set '(1 "hello" [1 2]))
#{1 "hello" [1 2]}
In a set, there are no duplicates

(set [1 1 "hello" "hello" [1 2] '(1 2)])
#{1 "hello" [1 2]}
Why [1 2] and (1 2) are considered as duplicates?

You can also create a set with the set literal #{}

#{1 2 "hello" [1 2]}
#{1 2 "hello" [1 2]}
But then, duplicates are forbidden!

#{1 2 3 1}
Syntax error reading source.
Set literal contains duplicate key: 1
What's the difference between set and distinct?

(distinct [1 1 "hello" "hello" [1 2] '(1 2)])
(1 "hello" [1 2])
You can also use (into #{}) to create a set

(into #{} [1 2 3 3 4])
#{1 2 3 4}
