===  Structural navigation

{meditation}The code is a tree.

TIP: Never use arrow keys to navigate in your code

== The REPL

REPL comes from the LISP tradition

REPL is much more than a shell or a browser console

=== The REPL connected to the IDE

. Evaluate the form that ends at caret
. Evaluate top form
. Evaluate the whole buffer
. Comment block

=== Debug without a debugger

spy

== Homeworks

. Practice structural editing on your IDE
. Navigate the code without arrow keys
